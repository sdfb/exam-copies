Python-based workflow for requesting exam copies from publishers

Many professors freqeuntly request exam copies to determine whether a book is right for a course they'll be teaching.  This Jupyter notebook was created to streamline the process of requesting multiple exam copies from multiple publishers.  Since many professors use Zotero to capture book metadata, the script takes in a Zotero-derived CSV export of books and creates request letters in Word for each item, using Pandas in the middle.
